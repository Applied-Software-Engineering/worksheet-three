# Worksheet Three

In this worksheet you will work through a number of exercises from <https://nodeschool.io>.

To start the process type the following at the command line (after installing `Node.js`):

```
npm install learnyounode

learnyounode
```

There are a number of exercises and you should attempt all of them.

Please note: If after executing the command `learnyounode` you receive a `not found` error, or similar, then you will need to specify the exact path to the executable. This is usually `node_modules/learnyounode/bin/learnyounode` but may vary on your system (especially if it is a Windows based machine). If you do experience problems then please raise it with the tutor.
